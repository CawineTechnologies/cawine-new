                your account and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other

                disable, or delete your account (or any part thereof) if we determine that you have violated any
                provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or content would tend to damage our reputation and

                We may block your email address and Internet protocol address to prevent further registration.</br></br>

                User content</br></br>

                We do not own any data, information or material (“Content”) that you submit in the Mobile Application in
                the course of using the Service. You shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality,
                integrity, legality, reliability, appropriateness, and intellectual property ownership or right to use
                of all submitted Content. We may, but have no obligation to, monitor and review Content in the Mobile
                Application submitted or created using our Services by you. Unless specifically permitted by you, your
                use of the Mobile Application does not grant us the license to use, reproduce, adapt, modify, publish or
                distribute the Content created by you or stored in your user account for commercial, marketing or any
                similar purpose. But you grant us permission to access, copy, distribute, store, transmit, reformat,
                display and perform the Content of your user account solely as required for the purpose of providing the
                Services to you. Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, we have the right, though
                not the obligation, to, in our own sole discretion, refuse or remove any Content that, in our reasonable
                opinion, violates any of our policies or is in any way harmful or objectionable.</br></br>

                Adult content</br></br>

                Please be aware that there may be certain adult or mature content available in the Mobile Application. A
                warning will be shown to the User prior to adult content being displayed. Where there is mature or adult
                content, individuals who are less than 18 years of age or are not permitted to access such content under
                the laws of any applicable jurisdiction may not access such content. If we learn that anyone under the
                age of 18 seeks to conduct a transaction through the Services, we will require verified parental
                consent, in accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”). Certain
                areas of the Mobile Application may not be available to children under 18 under any
                circumstances.</br></br>

                Backups</br></br>

                We perform regular backups of the Content and will do our best to ensure completeness and accuracy of
                these backups. In the event of the hardware failure or data loss we will restore backups automatically
                to minimize the impact and downtime.</br></br>

                Links to other mobile applications</br></br>
                Although this Mobile Application may link to other mobile applications, we are not, directly or
                indirectly, implying any approval, association, sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation with any linked
                mobile application, unless specifically stated herein. Some of the links in the Mobile Application may
                be “affiliate links”. This means if you click on the link and purchase an item, Cawine will receive an
                affiliate commission. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the
                offerings of, any businesses or individuals or the content of their mobile applications. We do not
                assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, products, services, and content of any other
                third-parties. You should carefully review the legal statements and other conditions of use of any
                mobile application which you access through a link from this Mobile Application. Your linking to any
                other off-site mobile applications is at your own risk.</br></br>

                <strong>PAYMENTS (VENUES)</strong></br>

                Use of the Services implies charges to you for the services or you receive (“Rental Fees”). Cawine will
                receive and/or enable your payment of the applicable Charges for services or obtained through your use
                of the Services. Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges may
                include other applicable fees.</br></br>

                All Charges and payments will be enabled by Cawine using the preferred payment method designated in your
                Account, after which you will receive a receipt by email. If your primary Account payment method is
                determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that Cawine may use a
                secondary payment method in your Account, if available. Charges paid by you are final and
                non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Cawine.</br></br>

                As between you and Cawine, Cawine reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise Charges for any
                or all services or goods obtained through the use of the Services at any time in Cawine’s sole
                discretion. Cawine will use reasonable efforts to inform you of Charges that may apply, provided that
                you will be responsible for Charges incurred under your Account regardless of your awareness of such
                Charges or the amounts thereof.</br></br>

                After you have received services or goods obtained through the Service, you will have the opportunity to
                rate your experience and leave additional feedback. Cawine may use the proceeds of any Charges for any
                purpose, subject to any payment obligations it has agreed to with any Third Party Providers or other
                third parties.</br></br>

                Prohibited uses</br></br>

                In addition to other terms as set forth in the Agreement, you are prohibited from using the Mobile
                Application or its Content: (a) for any unlawful purpose; (b) to solicit others to perform or

                to upload or transmit viruses or any other type of malicious code that will or may be used in any way
                that will affect the functionality or operation of the Service or of any related mobile application,
                other mobile applications, or the Internet; (h) to collect or track the personal information of others;
                (i) to spam, phish, pharm, pretext, spider, crawl, or scrape; (j) for any obscene or immoral purpose; or
                (k) to interfere with or circumvent the security features of the Service or any related mobile
                application, other mobile applications, or the Internet. We reserve the right to terminate your use of
                the Service or any related mobile application for violating any of the prohibited uses.</br></br>

                Intellectual property rights</br></br>

                This Agreement does not transfer to you any intellectual property owned by Cawine or third-parties, and
                all rights, titles, and interests in and to such property will remain (as between the parties) solely
                with Cawine. All trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection with our Mobile
                Application or Services, are trademarks or registered trademarks of Cawine or Cawine licensors. Other
                trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection with our Mobile Application or Services
                may be the trademarks of other third-parties. Your use of our Mobile Application and Services grants you
                no right or license to reproduce or otherwise use any Cawine or third-party trademarks.</br></br>

                Limitation of liability</br></br>

                To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will Cawine, its affiliates, officers,
                directors, employees, agents, suppliers or licensors be liable to any person for (a): any indirect,
                incidental, special, punitive, cover or consequential damages (including, without limitation, damages
                for lost profits, revenue, sales, goodwill, use of content, impact on business, business interruption,
                loss of anticipated savings, loss of business opportunity) however caused, under any theory of
                liability, including, without limitation, contract, tort, warranty, breach of statutory duty, negligence
                or otherwise, even if Cawine has been advised as to the possibility of such damages or could have
                foreseen such damages. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the aggregate liability of
                Cawine and its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, suppliers and licensors, relating to the
                services will be limited to an amount greater of one dollar or any amounts actually paid in cash by you
                to Cawine for the prior one month period prior to the first event or occurrence giving rise to such
                liability. The limitations and

                exclusions also apply if this remedy does not fully compensate you for any losses or fails of its
                essential purpose.</br></br>

                Indemnification</br></br>

                You agree to indemnify and hold Cawine and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, and agents
                harmless from and against any liabilities, losses, damages or costs, including reasonable attorneys’
                fees, incurred in connection with or arising from any third-party allegations, claims, actions,
                disputes, or demands asserted against any of them as a result of or relating to your Content, your use
                of the Mobile Application or Services or any wilful misconduct on your part.</br></br>

                Severability</br></br>

                All rights and restrictions contained in this Agreement may be exercised and shall be applicable and
                binding only to the extent that they do not violate any applicable laws and are intended to be limited
                to the extent necessary so that they will not render this Agreement illegal, invalid or unenforceable.
                If any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or
                unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, it is the intention of the parties that the
                remaining provisions or portions thereof shall constitute their agreement with respect to the subject
                matter hereof, and all such remaining provisions or portions thereof shall remain in full force and
                effect.</br></br>

                Dispute resolution</br></br>

                The formation, interpretation, and performance of this Agreement and any disputes arising out of it
                shall be governed by the substantive and procedural laws of Uganda without regard to its rules on
                conflicts or choice of law and, to the extent applicable, the laws of Uganda. The exclusive jurisdiction
                and venue for actions related to the subject matter hereof shall be the courts located in Uganda, and
                you hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts. You hereby waive any right to a jury
                trial in any proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement. The United Nations Convention on
                Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.</br></br>

                Changes and amendments</br></br>

                We reserve the right to modify this Agreement or its policies relating to the Mobile Application or
                Services at any time, effective upon posting of an updated version of this Agreement in the Mobile

                Application. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. Continued use of
                the Mobile Application after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes.</br></br>

                Acceptance of these terms</br></br>

                You acknowledge that you have read this Agreement and agree to all its terms and conditions. By using
                the Mobile Application or its Services you agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you do not agree to
