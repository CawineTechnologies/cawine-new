                <strong>BACKGROUND:</strong>

                These Terms of Use, together with all other documents referred to herein, set out the terms of use under
                which you may use this Application, (“Our Application”). You must read, agree, and accept all the Terms
                set
                out in this agreement which includes the terms and conditions set out below. You will be required to
                read
                and accept these Terms of Use when signing up for an Account. If you do not accept all the terms of this
                agreement, then Cawine is unwilling to allow you to use the Cawine platform.

                By using any of the services you become a User on the Cawine platform and you agree to be bound by the
                terms
                and conditions of this agreement with respect to the provision or use of such services. If you do not
                agree
                to be bound by the terms of this agreement, do not use Cawine.

                We may amend this agreement at any time by posting the amended terms on the Cawine application. You may
                not
                have access to the Cawine application before accepting these terms. These Terms of Use do not apply to
                the
                sale of services.

                DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION

                In these Terms of Use, unless the context otherwise requires, the following expressions have the

                Accounts and membership

                You must be at least 18 years of age to use this Mobile Application. By using this Mobile Application
                and by
                agreeing to this Agreement you warrant and represent that you are at least 18 years of age. If you
                create an
                account in the Mobile Application, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and
                you
                are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in
                connection with it. We may, but have no obligation to, monitor and review new accounts before you may
                sign
                in and use our Services. Providing false contact information of any kind may result in the termination
                of
                your account. You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account or any other
                breaches
                of security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind
                incurred as a result of such acts or omissions. We may suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any
                part
                thereof) if we determine that you have violated any provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or
                content would tend to damage our reputation and goodwill. If we delete your account for the foregoing
                reasons, you may not re-register for our Services. We may block your email address and Internet protocol
                address to prevent further registration.

                User content

                We do not own any data, information or material (“Content”) that you submit in the Mobile Application in
                the
                course of using the Service. You shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, integrity,
                legality, reliability, appropriateness, and intellectual property ownership or right to use of all
                submitted
                Content. We may, but have no obligation to, monitor and review Content in the Mobile Application
                submitted
                or created using our Services by you. Unless specifically permitted by you, your use of the Mobile
                Application does not grant us the license to use, reproduce, adapt, modify, publish or distribute the
                Content created by you or stored in your user account for commercial, marketing or any similar purpose.
                But
                you grant us permission to access, copy, distribute, store, transmit, reformat, display and perform the
                Content of your user account solely as required for the purpose of providing the Services to you.
                Without
                limiting any of those representations or warranties, we have the right, though not the obligation, to,
                in
                our own sole discretion, refuse or remove any Content that, in our reasonable opinion, violates any of
                our
                policies or is in any way harmful or objectionable.

                Adult content

                Please be aware that there may be certain adult or mature content available in the Mobile Application. A
                warning will be shown to the User prior to adult content being displayed. Where there is mature or adult
                content, individuals who are less than 18 years of age or are not permitted to access such content under
                the
                laws of any applicable jurisdiction may not access such content. If we learn that anyone under the age
                of 18
                seeks to conduct a transaction through the Services, we will require verified parental consent, in
                accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”). Certain areas of the
                Mobile
                Application may not be available to children under 18 under any circumstances.

                Backups

                We perform regular backups of the Content and will do our best to ensure completeness and accuracy of
                these
                backups. In the event of the hardware failure or data loss we will restore backups automatically to
                minimize
                the impact and downtime.

                Links to other mobile applications

                Although this Mobile Application may link to other mobile applications, we are not, directly or
                indirectly,
                implying any approval, association, sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation with any linked mobile
                application, unless specifically stated herein. Some of the links in the Mobile Application may be
                “affiliate links”. This means if you click on the link and purchase an item, Cawine will receive an
                affiliate commission. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the
                offerings of, any businesses or individuals or the content of their mobile applications. We do not
                assume
                any responsibility or liability for the actions, products, services, and content of any other
                third-parties.
                You should carefully review the legal statements and other conditions of use of any mobile application
                which
                you access through a link from this Mobile Application. Your linking to any other off-site mobile
                applications is at your own risk.

                PAYMENTS (VENUES)

                Use of the Services implies charges to you for the services or you receive (“Rental Fees”). Cawine will
                receive and/or enable your payment of the applicable Charges for services or obtained through your use
                of
                the Services. Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges may include
                other
                applicable fees.

                All Charges and payments will be enabled by Cawine using the preferred payment method designated in your
                Account, after which you will receive a receipt by email. If your primary Account payment method is
                determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that Cawine may use a
                secondary payment method in your Account, if available. Charges paid by you are final and
                non-refundable,
                unless otherwise determined by Cawine.

                As between you and Cawine, Cawine reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise Charges for any
                or
                all services or goods obtained through the use of the Services at any time in Cawine’s sole discretion.
                Cawine will use reasonable efforts to inform you of Charges that may apply, provided that you will be
                responsible for Charges incurred under your Account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the
                amounts thereof.

                After you have received services or goods obtained through the Service, you will have the opportunity to
                rate your experience and leave additional feedback. Cawine may use the proceeds of any Charges for any
                purpose, subject to any payment obligations it has agreed to with any Third Party Providers or other
                third
                parties.

                Prohibited uses

                In addition to other terms as set forth in the Agreement, you are prohibited from using the Mobile
                Application or its Content: (a) for any unlawful purpose; (b) to solicit others to perform or

                disability; (f) to submit false or misleading information; (g) to upload or transmit viruses or any
                other
                type of malicious code that will or may be used in any way that will affect the functionality or
                operation
                of the Service or of any related mobile application, other mobile applications, or the Internet; (h) to
                collect or track the personal information of others; (i) to spam, phish, pharm, pretext, spider, crawl,
                or

                features
                of the Service or any related mobile application, other mobile applications, or the Internet. We reserve
                the
                right to terminate your use of the Service or any related mobile application for violating any of the
                prohibited uses.

                Intellectual property rights

                This Agreement does not transfer to you any intellectual property owned by Cawine or third-parties, and
                all
                rights, titles, and interests in and to such property will remain (as between the parties) solely with
                Cawine. All trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection with our Mobile Application
                or
                Services, are trademarks or registered trademarks of Cawine or Cawine licensors. Other trademarks,
                service
                marks, graphics and logos used in connection with our Mobile Application or Services may be the
                trademarks
                of other third-parties. Your use of our Mobile Application and Services grants you no right or license
                to
                reproduce or otherwise use any Cawine or third-party trademarks.

                Limitation of liability

                To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will Cawine, its affiliates, officers,
                directors, employees, agents, suppliers or licensors be liable to any person for (a): any indirect,
                incidental, special, punitive, cover or consequential damages (including, without limitation, damages
                for
                lost profits, revenue, sales, goodwill, use of content, impact on business, business interruption, loss
                of
                anticipated savings, loss of business opportunity) however caused, under any theory of liability,
                including,
                without limitation, contract, tort, warranty, breach of statutory duty, negligence or otherwise, even if
                Cawine has been advised as to the possibility of such damages or could have foreseen such damages. To
                the
                maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the aggregate liability of Cawine and its affiliates,
                officers,
                employees, agents, suppliers and licensors, relating to the services will be limited to an amount
                greater of
                one dollar or any amounts actually paid in cash by you to Cawine for the prior one month period prior to
                the
                first event or occurrence giving rise to such liability. The limitations and exclusions also apply if
                this
                remedy does not fully compensate you for any losses or fails of its essential purpose.

                Indemnification

                You agree to indemnify and hold Cawine and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, and agents
                harmless from and against any liabilities, losses, damages or costs, including reasonable attorneys’
                fees,
                incurred in connection with or arising from any third-party allegations, claims, actions, disputes, or
                demands asserted against any of them as a result of or relating to your Content, your use of the Mobile
                Application or Services or any wilful misconduct on your part.

                Severability

                All rights and restrictions contained in this Agreement may be exercised and shall be applicable and
                binding
                only to the extent that they do not violate any applicable laws and are intended to be limited to the
                extent
                necessary so that they will not render this Agreement illegal, invalid or unenforceable. If any
                provision or
                portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by a
                court
                of competent jurisdiction, it is the intention of the parties that the remaining provisions or portions
                thereof shall constitute their agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof, and all such
                remaining
                provisions or portions thereof shall remain in full force and effect.

                Dispute resolution

                The formation, interpretation, and performance of this Agreement and any disputes arising out of it
                shall be
                governed by the substantive and procedural laws of Uganda without regard to its rules on conflicts or
                choice
                of law and, to the extent applicable, the laws of Uganda. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for
                actions
                related to the subject matter hereof shall be the courts located in Uganda, and you hereby submit to the
                personal jurisdiction of such courts. You hereby waive any right to a jury trial in any proceeding
                arising
                out of or related to this Agreement. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
                Sale
                of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.

                Returns and refunds

                Returns are processed by the local store and are subject to their individual policy. Please contact the
                store to confirm their specific process. The store contact phone number can be found on your order
                confirmation email.

                If the wrong product has been delivered or is spoiled, stores will commonly coordinate a time to pick up
                the
                product for a return. In these instances, returns are usually accepted within 5 days of the purchase.
                Refunds are processed as soon the product is returned and typically hit your bank account/Mobile account
                within 3-5 business days after bank processing.

                Changes and amendments

                We reserve the right to modify this Agreement or its policies relating to the Mobile Application or
                Services
                at any time, effective upon posting of an updated version of this Agreement in the Mobile Application.
                When
                we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. Continued use of the Mobile
                Application
                after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes.
